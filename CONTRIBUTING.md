# Contributing

Thank you for collaborating in the development of MELKIT! Here you have some instructions on how to colaborate in its development.

## Issues

If you want to report a bug, propose a new feature, or simply have questions about how MELKIT works, feel free to do so through an **issue**.

Please, remember to check beforehand if your issue has already been published or resolved, and use the appropriate **template** depending on its goal.

Here are some tips if you consider posting an issue:

* Issues published must conform to the appropriate template (`BUG`, `FEATURE`, `QUESTION`).
* Use a sufficiently explanatory title.
* Appropriate tags should be added (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.).
* Do not skimp on details and favor the reproducibility of the proposed issues.

## Pull requests

If you want to collaborate in the development of MELKIT through a pull request, please follow these steps:

* Create an **issue** where you outline the work to be done.
* Clone the repository and start coding! Be sure to work on the most recent version of the project, and on a branch whose name specifies the type of issue addressed (e.g. `feature-<issue>`, `bug-<issue>`). Do not forget to install `requirements.txt`.
* If your change requires it, please remember to update the project documentation.
* Don't forget to ensure proper **code formatting** and **typing**.
* Once the work is finished, publish your pull request. Explain your changes using the proposed **template** and use an **explanatory title**. If your PR represents a new feature, indicate it with `[FEATURE]` at the beginning of the title. If it is a bug fix, add `[FIX] making the PR intention easier to understand.
* Remember to assign a reviewer and indicate which issues were addressed or your pull request is closing.
* Once the necessary feedback is received, continue iterating until your proposal is accepted.

Thanks for collaborating!
