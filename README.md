**MELGYM** is a [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium)-based interface designed to facilitate interactive control over [MELCOR](https://melcor.sandia.gov/) 1.8.6 simulations.

Every control functionality in MELCOR is determined by Control Functions (CFs). However, the batch execution mode of MELCOR makes it difficult to interactively control and modify functions under certain user-defined conditions. Control conditions are defined a priori and sometimes requires the concatenation of several CFs that must be done in an unfriendly way.

MELGYM allows the definition of external user-defined controllers, allowing the use of reinforcement learning agents or any other custom control algorithm.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works?

MELGYM leverages MELCOR's restart capabilities to modify CFs every few simulation cycles. Just before a *warm start* is performed, the underlying MELCOR model is modified according to the last registered simulation state, and continues running until the next control action is performed.

## üñ•Ô∏è Setting up experiments

MELGYM environments adhere to the Gymnasium interface, and can be combined with DRL libraries such as [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

```python
import melgym
import gymnasium as gym

from stable_baselines3 import PPO

env = gym.make('pressure-v0')

# Training
agent = PPO('MlpPolicy', env)
agent.learn(total_timesteps=10_000)

# Evaluation
obs, _ = env.reset()
done = trunc = False

while not (done or trunc):
    env.render()
    act, _ = agent.predict(obs)
    obs, rew, done, trunc, info = env.step(act)      

env.close()
```

## üß∞ Side projects

MELGYM rely on the auxiliar toolbox [MELKIT](https://github.com/manjavacas/melkit/). Feel free to help us improving both projects!
